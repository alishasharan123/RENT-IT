# RENT-IT
The basic idea behind this project was to create a platform, where people can provide their useless things on rent for other people who desire that particular thing. Simultaneously, other person can purchase that things on rent. We have used HTML5 and CSS along with JS to provide the frontend and PHP along with MySQL for the backend, database designing and handling.
